# [How to perform Keras hyperparameter optimization x3 faster on TPU for free](https://www.dlology.com/blog/how-to-perform-keras-hyperparameter-optimization-on-tpu-for-free/) | DLology Blog


## How to Run
Require [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4.exe) and [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) installed
### Clone or download this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Tony607/Keras_auto
```
### Install required libraries
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


In the project start a command line run
```
jupyter notebook
```
To do hyperparameter optimization on TPU in Google Colab. Use `Keras_Fashion_MNIST_TPU.ipynb` or use this shared [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kpCDInclZHLOvb-9MOgQHUfJfsg8748Z).


To do hyperparameter optimization on GPU/CPU, in the opened browser window open
```
Keras_Fashion_MNIST_GPU.ipynb
```
